# tweetPeep

I'm [Kazuki](https://twitter.com/kazuki_sf_), a creator of Tweet Peep ðŸ‘€

Thanks for adding Tweet Peep ðŸ‘€ into your Chrome!

Though this is my weekend project and I built this in a few hours, I see a huge value in it and am very happy to share it with you!

As a reader, I am often curious about what people think about the article, video, and podcast that I am reading/watching. I often paste the link of the content on the Twitter search bar and search what people are saying.

Also, as a blogger, I sometimes see what people are tweeting about my blog posts via the Twitter search. Knowing someoneâ€™s thoughts always broadens my horizons, and it's fun!

I think Twitter is still the best place to meet great minds thoughts efficiently, and this is the reason why I love Twitter and can't stop using it almost every day.

Tweet Peep ðŸ‘€ is to shorten this great-minds-meet-alike process, and I really mean it!

## Features

### (1) `Peep Thoughts on Twitter` (Cmd + Shift + E)

- You can see what people are saying about the website you're viewing.

### (2) `Direct Search on Twitter`

Hope you enjoy it!


Cheers,

Kazuki
